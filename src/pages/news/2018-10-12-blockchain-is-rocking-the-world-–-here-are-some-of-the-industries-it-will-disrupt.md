Blockchain is a new technology that is expected to massively transform the world much like the internet has done in the past 20 years. Taken from an infographic from [Bitfortune](https://bitfortune.net/), here are some of the facts about blockchain and the potential that lies within.

Blockchain reduces the costs of the total amount of cross-border payments by 2-3%, which might sound like nothing major, but if you take a company that imports or exports worth billions of dollars, that is a huge saving, which can impact the economy of an entire country. Additionally, it can potentially save 70% of business costs.

Nearly 90% of people interested in blockchain technology believe that it will disrupt the current finance industry, and 33% of executives are considering adopting the technology or are already using it. Microsoft and Accenture both teamed up to create an identification system for populations living in poorer countries around the world, which is expected to give legal identity to over a billion people in 2018.

Currently, 90% of financial institutions in North America and Europe are exploring the potential uses for using blockchain to help better the transactions for their clients. There are some countries which have completely adopted blockchain technology as their central banking system, such as The Royal Bank of Canada, The Central Bank of Lithuania and Deutsche Bank.

This technology has a high level of security and its benefits include decentralization, protected communication, the reduction and ultimate elimination of fraud and errors, smart contracts, and confidentiality.

Certain companies have seen the potential for blockchain and are creating their own forms just for their industry, such as IBM and Maersk who together are creating a blockchain system just for shipping. FedEx created a system to help solve customer disputes, and British Airways have tested the technology for the transfer of flight data.

Who knows what other industries will implement blockchain technology in the future, but one thing is certain, it is already changing our online world whether we are up to speed on this technology or not. Take a look at the infographic below for more interesting facts about blockchain.
