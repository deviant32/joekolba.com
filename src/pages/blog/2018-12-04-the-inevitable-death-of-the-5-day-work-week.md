## Working hard to fill the time

I have always been an entrepreneur all of my life.  As my goal of owning by own business seems like something more achievable, I have been starting to think about how I would run my business.  

Looking around the office after lunch all I see is a bunch of burned out employees that have been sitting 8+ hours every day either slaving away at painful tasks that could be automated or trying to make it look like they have been productive.  This is not the way I want to live my life at all.

**Here is my solution:**

* 4 day work weeks (not 10 hour days, maybe 8 at the very most)
* Planned work, work in sprints, work is clearly outlined and planning accounts for problems that might occur.
* Once all work is complete and meets all requirements, all employees are done working for the remainder of the sprint.  I believe this will help encourage innovative ways to solve problems.
* More even pay-scales.  Sorry executives, no more high paid positions.  Not quite universal pay, but something in the middle.
* Automate everything, if a job can be automated, it will be eliminated.  
* Encourage creating side businesses that compliment your business.
* Good food, you should never have to pay for anything at work.  The idea is to lower all stress at work.
